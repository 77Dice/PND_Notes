>  [sniffing](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/ethical_hacking/ethical_hacking_sniffing.htm) : [tools](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/ethical_hacking/ethical_hacking_sniffing_tools.htm)

- work in passive/active mode ,++ promisquous mode  :: 
- use tools ... list 
- capture all clear data sent by unsafe protocols (without encryption on the medium)

-  how do it ?
   -  NIC in promisquous mode 
   -  sniffer on the hub/same network/ wire 
      -  non switched lan
      -  switched lans by flooding (**breaks switch segmentation**)
      -  by **arp spoof** attack and redirect traffic (men in the middle like)
      - wireless lan (only if **no or weak encryption is used**)
      - 

- bridges :: what they are?
- switches :: //?
- CAM //?


- how break the switch segmentation mechanism??
  - CAM overflow ..

# ARP spoofing/poisoning

how it works + ARP table
- responses 
- security of ARP
- type of attacks :
  - DOS
  - MITM attack


# IPv6 Neighbor Discovery
IPv6 Neighbor Discovery threats

- how addr resolution works in IPv6?

- known threats  RFC 3756

● IPv6 Rogue RA (or RA spoofing)
● Rogue DHCP
